                Good morning James, superb job on this project! The only issue I see is that your navigation
                wraps when the page is resized down horizontally. The way Google handles this is by keeping
                it in place using white-space styling. Another method is by not setting a fixed height on div#nav
                and instead doing min-height so the container increases as needed.

                    found I could wreak all kinds of havoc on the DOM. If I knew then what I know now, 'toggleClass' could have saved hours of time

                    Nice job on this project James! There are two issues I would like to point out.
                    First your container for the "Happy Day" text isn't wide enough. Also the content below the
                    headline shifts up slightly when you swap out text.

            <p><strong>Skill Development: </strong> On the design front I timidly stayed with some safe shades of grey. I thoroughly
                enjoyed using jQuery to provide help text, highlight buttons, trigger a cheat button as a kindness to busy folk, and
            create a progress tracker for those of us with poor memories.</p>

            <p><strong>Frank Troglauer Jr</strong> Oct 18, 2013 Looking good James. Couple of suggestions.
            1. Keep users from entering just spaces or nothing as a "guess".
            2. Allow users to press enter to submit a guess
            3. Add hover effects for the buttons, perhaps just change text from gray to white.
            I like the clear button. Overall nice job on this project!ï»¿</p>

            <p><strong>Skill Development: </strong> I explored other components of the jQuery API
                and I continue to be amazed at what it can do. I also found, evaluated, and incorporated useful libraries. <br>That said,

            <p><strong>Grae Drake</strong> Oct 23, 2013 Hey, looks good.  Only critique I have is that you probably want to include the
                sortable code in your document.ready() function.  Not actually critical in this implementation, since you can't add any
                items to the shopping list until the document is ready, but it's best practice to keep everything in there,
                and could be important were you to make changes down the road. P.S.  The color palette is... a good start.  Can't wait to
                see what you do once you make it into Unit 4.  Feel free to peek at the color theory materials in U4L4.  Oh, and if you're lacking a good bedtime read you might want to start on
                The Design of Everyday Things, available in U4L1.  Remember: it's the door's fault.ï»¿

            <p><strong>Grae Drake</strong> Nov 12, 2013 Hey Jim, great job.  This is a beautiful app.  Agree that more feedback
            would be good with the final question.  Right now you establish a (subtle) pattern with the  first four questions,
            then set the user up for a gotcha with the final question.  Rather than just omitting the blur effect (which focuses
            attention on one option) I'd consider some way of emphasizing the "correctness" of all four options in the final
            question.  Maybe something like displaying a relevant quote for each one?ï»¿</p>

            Loading image is floating over the bottom of the container. If you initiate a search on the image tab it doesn't show the loading

            You've got a good thing going on. A couple things (as FTj says): nothing but kudos to mentor mmichon; great listening skills, he could hear the question behind the question,
            emails encouraged and timely responses, always pointed me in useful directions, but I wonder if I could have benefited from 2 sessions a week. I know office hours and all that
            but I was reticent about speaking there, getting the staffperson up to speed on the confusion, etc. The other thing was some
            unsureness about making comments to peers. As newcomers joined the Dolphins I saw predictable patterns in the questions and in their project's
            'missed things'. There were times I thought I could helpfully comment but then thought 'perhaps that is overstepping bounds'. So any clarity there might
            help newcomers. Again, great job.</p>
