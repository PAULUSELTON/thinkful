                Good morning James, superb job on this project! The only issue I see is that your navigation
                wraps when the page is resized down horizontally. The way Google handles this is by keeping
                it in place using white-space styling. Another method is by not setting a fixed height on div#nav
                and instead doing min-height so the container increases as needed.

                <p><strong>Baseline: </strong>Who hasn't heard of JQuery. I had never tried it.</p>

                <p><strong>Skill Development: </strong> jQuery is magical. Helped by it's excellent documentation and stack<b>overflow</b> I
                    found I could wreak all kinds of havoc on the DOM. If I knew then what I know now, 'toggleClass' could have saved hours of time
                and cut the codebase down by 2/3rds... but at the time what I already 'knew' was making it difficult.</p>
                <p>I opened a GitHub account and bought an app to manage it. Within a couple days the app was never opened
                   as the program GitHub provides is far better.</p>
                <p>I created a nice little javascript 'Day of the Week' function.</p>

                    Nice job on this project James! There are two issues I would like to point out.
                    First your container for the "Happy Day" text isn't wide enough. Also the content below the
                    headline shifts up slightly when you swap out text.

            <p><strong>Frank Troglauer Jr</strong> Oct 18, 2013 Looking good James. Couple of suggestions.
            1. Keep users from entering just spaces or nothing as a "guess".
            2. Allow users to press enter to submit a guess
            3. Add hover effects for the buttons, perhaps just change text from gray to white.
            I like the clear button. Overall nice job on this project!ï»¿</p>

            <p><strong>Grae Drake</strong> Oct 23, 20131 Hey, looks good.  Only critique I have is that you probably want to include the
                sortable code in your document.ready() function.  Not actually critical in this implementation, since you can't add any
                items to the shopping list until the document is ready, but it's best practice to keep everything in there,
                and could be important were you to make changes down the road. P.S.  The color palette is... a good start.  Can't wait to
                see what you do once you make it into Unit 4.  Feel free to peek at the color theory materials in U4L4.  Oh, and if you're lacking a good bedtime read you might want to start on
